# Thesis: Evaluation of Deep Learning and Computer Vision Algorithms for Optical Character Recognition on Aircraft Engine Components  written at 3D.aero GmbH, TUHH


## Abstract:
To inspect the aircraft engines and maintenance of different engines it is 
important to have the information of the respective aircraft engines. One step 
of this inspection/reporting process is to read and check part or serial numbers 
of different engine components. These components are often "hidden" behind 
other components and are therefore located "inside" of the engine. The text 
from the aircraft engines will be comprising of following details such as engine 
model number, engine assembly number, emission, manufacture date etc. 
Manual inspection and collecting the desired text information is a challenging 
and tedious task. To overcome the challenges of the obtaining the text 
information from aircraft engines, custom OCR application is to be developed. 
State of the art techniques from Deep Learning and Computer Vision are 
adopted for developing the proposed application. This thesis investigates the 
possibilities to create an automatic inspection system by evaluating different 
machine learning algorithms for optical character recognition (OCR) on aircraft 
engines
